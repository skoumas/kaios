# KAIOS Test
In this demo we are creating a templating framework from scratch using only Vanilla code.

There are two solutions submitted.

## Custom Vanilla Javascript Templating Engine
For making this work I took a quick lesson from https://hackernoon.com/build-your-own-react-48edb8ed350d.
After studing here I adjusted the findings for this example to work.

### Solution One (Universal DOM updates)
`index.html`
In this example the DOM is recalculated each time. You will find CSS and JS under their folders.

### Solution Two (Speficic DOM updates)
`index.2.html`
This solution assigns an id to each element which corresponds to the class name of the element.
The `reRender()` function here simply refreshes that element only and leaves the rest of the DOM intact.

## Personal Data Storage Test 
We have been asked to be complient with data policies and secure our client's data the best way possible.
The data is being generated by the user's interaction with the phone using the event Logger.

We are presented with three major options:
a) Calculate Event Logger and Store the data at the device
b) Calculate Events at the cloud and send back to the device to store as data
c) Calculate Events at the cloud and store at the cloud

## Option A

### PROS 
- The data is being saved IN the device so there is no way to get a data breach that will affect a massive amount of users
- The data can be deleted at any time from the OS giving the `right to be forgotten` to the user
### CONS
- The OS needs to calculate the event's somethign that creates burdain to the OS. 
- Getting difficult to update the algorithm that calculates the event logger. Update only possible throught FOTA


## Option B

### PROS 
- The data is being saved IN the device so there is no way to get a data breach that will affect a massive amount of users
- The data can be deleted at any time from the OS giving the `right to be forgotten` to the user
### CONS
- The OS needs to calculate the event's somethign that creates burdain to the OS. 
- Getting difficult to update the algorithm that calculates the event logger. Update only possible throught FOTA




## Option C


### PROS 
- The data is being saved IN the device so there is no way to get a data breach that will affect a massive amount of users
- The data can be deleted at any time from the OS giving the `right to be forgotten` to the user
### CONS
- The OS needs to calculate the event's somethign that creates burdain to the OS. 
- Getting difficult to update the algorithm that calculates the event logger. Update only possible throught FOTA
